    "In Python, `self` is a special parameter that refers to the instance of the class (the object) I'm working with. When I define a method within a class, the first parameter of that method is always `self`, by convention. This helps Python know that the method belongs to an instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**I think of `self` as a way to refer to \"this object\"** — the specific object that is calling the method. It gives each object its own set of attributes and allows access to methods that belong to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever I do something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_car.drive()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the drive method, Python secretly turns it into:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Car.drive(my_car)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So inside the method, `self == my_car`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Do I Need `self`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Without `self`, Python wouldn't know which object I'm referring to when I use attributes or methods within a class. `self` ensures that each object can keep its own data separate and gives me a way to work with an object's attributes and methods.\n"
