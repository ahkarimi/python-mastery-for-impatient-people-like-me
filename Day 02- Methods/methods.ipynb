    "2. **Each account has a balance** - but it CANNOT go negative (validation needed!)\n",

    "4. **Interest rate validation** - same rule applies to ALL accounts (0-5% only)\n",
    "5. **Minimum balance rule** - ALL accounts must maintain at least $100\n",
    "\n",
    "**The nightmare without methods:**\n",
    "- I'd write validation code 50 times\n",
    "- I'd copy-paste logging everywhere\n",
    "- If I change a rule, I'd have to update 50 places\n",
    "- One typo = bugs everywhere\n",

    "## 🎯 THE WHOLE POINT OF METHODS - Why They Exist\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, I've built this whole banking system. Let me step back and understand WHY methods exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem Methods Solve\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without methods**, I'd have to:\n",
    "- Write validation code 50 times (once per account operation)\n",
    "- Copy-paste logging everywhere\n",
    "- Update 50 places if a rule changes\n",
    "- Risk bugs from typos/inconsistencies\n",
    "\n",
    "**With methods**, I:\n",
    "- Write validation ONCE in `_is_valid_amount()`\n",
    "- Write logging ONCE in `__log_transaction()`\n",
    "- Change rules ONCE (class variables, class methods)\n",
    "- All accounts automatically use the updated logic\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Key Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods = Reusable Behavior**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of repeating code, I define behavior ONCE in the class. Every instance uses it. This is:\n",
    "- **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself)\n",
    "- **Maintainable** (change once, works everywhere)\n",
    "- **Organized** (related code lives together)\n",
    "- **Encapsulated** (hide messy details, expose clean API)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method Types - Quick Reference\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Instance methods** (`self`): Actions each account can do\n",
    "   - `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, `get_balance()`\n",
    "   - Operate on ONE specific account\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Protected methods** (`_method`): Internal helpers\n",
    "   - `_is_valid_amount()`\n",
    "   - Convention: \"internal use, but accessible\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Private methods** (`__method`): Implementation details\n",
    "   - `__log_transaction()`\n",
    "   - Name-mangled: truly internal\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Class variables**: Shared state for ALL instances\n",
    "   - `MIN_BALANCE = 100`\n",
    "   - Change once, affects everyone\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Static methods** (`@staticmethod`): Utility functions\n",
    "   - `is_valid_interest_rate()`\n",
    "   - No instance data needed, just related to the class\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Class methods** (`@classmethod`): Class-level actions\n",
    "   - `set_min_balance()`, `create_premium_account()`\n",
    "   - Operate on the class itself, not instances\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Bottom Line\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods let me organize code by **behavior**, not just data. They're the difference between:\n",
    "- A pile of variables and functions (messy)\n",
    "- A cohesive class with organized behavior (clean)\n",
    "\n",
    "**That's it. That's why methods exist.**\n"

    "## 💡 Quick Mental Model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of methods like this:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instance method** = \"This account can do X\"\n",
    "  - `alice.deposit(100)` → Alice's account deposits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Protected method** = \"Internal helper, but you might need it\"\n",
    "  - `_is_valid_amount()` → Used internally, but accessible if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Private method** = \"Implementation detail, stay away!\"\n",
    "  - `__log_transaction()` → How logging works is none of your business\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class variable** = \"Rule that applies to EVERYONE\"\n",
    "  - `MIN_BALANCE = 100` → All accounts must follow this\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Static method** = \"Utility function related to this class\"\n",
    "  - `is_valid_interest_rate()` → Doesn't need account data, just validates\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class method** = \"Action on the class itself\"\n",
    "  - `set_min_balance()` → Changes the rule for ALL accounts\n",
